### Hey there! 👋 I'm Nick Lepore (@nicklepore25), proud alumni of Tyngsboro's Elementary School of 2004. 

Welcome to my personal corner of the web! I’m Nick Lepore 🏳️‍🌈, an applied statistician based in New York City. I hold a Master of Science in Statistics from New York University, with a concentration in computational methodologies. My academic journey sparked a deep interest in Bayesian mathematics, machine learning, large language models, probability theory, and social science.

In addition to my passion for statistics and data, music has always been a major part of my life. You’ll often find me grooving to Beyoncé 🪩, Joni Mitchell, ABBA, Stevie Nicks, and all things 80s music.

My client experiences have been dedicated to championing progressive causes and candidates up and down ballot. My work has contributed to the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights through collaborations with the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), the Trevor Project, the Gill Foundation, Everytown, and UCLA’s Williams Institute. My work, particularly with MAP, has helped provide state-based groups with strategic messaging and demographic analysis on how to best discuss gender-affirming care to voters, ban conversion therapy in state and local communities, and target swing voters in hard-to-win elections.

This github is a space where I’ll share my insights, opinions, post some helpful functions and code, hot-takes, and the occasional rant. Feel free to take a look around!
